        Here is the main content, we have created a simple and modular layout that goes beyond a grid, we have included an image,
        description of the plan, and vehicle requirements to qualify. The color scheme of the images reflects its respective company's 
        brand identity. We hid it behind a button to allow for a clean look and to allow the user to get straight to the content they 
        want without having to scroll through inappliccable plans. We used large images to help the users see what they need without 
        the clutter of text. The multi-colored backdrops of the images are in the brand colors of the companies they originate from
        this allows users to make associations easily.
